# Other components

In the interest of time, there are several other components we will not build during this workshop. These are simple components which follow the same principles as the ones we have built and they are already included in `nitflex_dev_theme` .

Here's a list of the pre-built components.

* Add to favorite: Allows us to add movies to our playlist.
* Average rating: Allows us to rate movies from 1 - 5.
* Body text: A simple pattern to render plain text.
* Branding: Site's logo.
* Icons: Icons system for our theme.
* and MPAA rating: To rate movies using mpaa rating (i.e. PG-13).
