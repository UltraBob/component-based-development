# Components Variations

Components variations are new instances of a component with small or big changes. Variations are great ways to use an existing component and extend it to change its look and/or behavior. [More on components variations here](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/pattern-variations/).

Based on our prototype, we have at least two different buttons. One with red outline and one with white outline. Text color and background color on hover is also different between the two. We will write the required styles for each button, but we will rely on Pattern Lab to create variations for us. This is a huge advantage of using tools like Pattern Lab because it does all the heavy lifting for us. Without Pattern Lab we would need to create a new version of the button component which would require we duplicate a lot of the code we already wrote, but Pattern Lab takes the code we wrote in the previous exercise and extends it for the new variation. Let's take a look at how this works.

1. Inside the **button** directory create a new file called **button~primary.yml**. \(Notice the tilde \("`~`"\) in the file name\).
2. Update`button~primary.yml` as follows:

```yaml
button:
  modifier: button--primary
  text: "Primary button"
  type:
  url: "#"
```

## How Pattern Lab handles variations

* Pattern lab use [pseudo patterns](https://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-pseudo-patterns.html) to create pattern variations. This is accomplished by creating a new data file \(.yml\), which includes the name of the pattern we want to create a variation for, as well as the variation name.  For example, when creating a variation named **primary** for the button pattern, our new data file would be `button~primary.yml`.
* You may have noticed the file name we just created uses a tilde symbol \(`~`\). This tells Pattern Lab we want a new variation in this case for the button pattern.
* The value for **modifier** is what Pattern Lab uses as the pattern's modifier class.
* If we wanted another variation for a large button for example, we would create a new `.yml` file with the name `button~large.yml`, and the value for **modifier** would be `button--large`.

## Updating the button styles

Now that we have a new button variaton let's add css styles to it.

* Edit `button.scss` so the styles look like this :

  ```css
  .button {
    // keep all previous code.

    // Add this new code to update border color and hover states.
    &.button--primary {
      border-color: $color-bright-red;
    â€‹
      &:hover,
      &:focus {
        background: $color-bright-red;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

The new code starts at `&.button--primary`. This means .button and .button--primary classes will be together \(i.e. `<a class="button button--primary">My button</a>`\), and when they do we are changing background, text and border color to red. Before we can see the new variation in action, we need to update the pattern's twig template so it's aware when a variation is needed.

* Now let's edit the twig file to look like this:

  ```php
  {% if button.modifier %}
    {% set modifier_class = button.modifier|clean_class %}
  {% endif %}

  {% if button.url %}
    <a href="{{ button.url }}" class="button {{ modifier_class }}">
      {{ button.text }}
    </a>
  {% elseif button.type %}
    <input
      type="{{ button.type|default('submit') }}"
      class="button {{ modifier_class }}">
      {{ button.text }}
    </input>
  {% else %}
    <button
      class="button {{ modifier_class }}">
      {{ button.text }}
    </button>
  {% endif %}
  ```

  * First we check whether the **modifier** key has a value, and if it does we create a new variable with that value \(i.e. `modifier_class`\).
  * Then we pass the `{{ modifier_class }}` variable within the class attribute.

## Compiling the code

Now that we have written all the necessary code to build the button' variations, it's time to see the component in the style-guide. Let's compile our project first.

* In your command line, navigate to `/themes/custom/nitflex_dev_theme`.
* Run this command:

```bash
lando npm run build && lando php patternlab/core/console --generate
```

**What does this command do?**

_The command above runs all gulp tasks found inside the gulp-tasks directory in the theme. Keep in mind, we are using the word **lando** because our local environment was built with lando. Typically the build command would be **npm run build**._

## Viewing the component

* Open your Drupal site and point to the URL below: [http://nitflex.lndo.site/themes/custom/nitflex\_dev\_theme/public/](http://nitflex.lndo.site/themes/custom/nitflex_dev_theme/public/)

  Under the Components category you should see the new Heading component.
