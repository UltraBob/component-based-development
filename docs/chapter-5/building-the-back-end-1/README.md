# Building the back-end

{% hint style="info" %}
All back-end building and configuration has already been done as part of the Lando environment. However, if you wish to take a closer look at what's involved in building the back-end, we are including all the pieces required for this project in individual sections \(Image styles, content types, taxonomy, views, etc.\)
{% endhint %}

Please follow the steps in this section in the same order they have been created as this ensures dependencies are met prior to working on a specific section of the site. For example, before you can build the movie list view, you need to have the movie content type built, which in turn also has a dependency of taxonomy vocabulary and image styles.
