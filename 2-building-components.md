# Component-based Development with Drupal 8

## Building Components
This training is broken down in three parts:  Building Components, Preparing Drupal for Components Integration, and finally, Integrating components with Drupal.

### Generating the styleguide
Before we can build components, we need to generate a living styleguide to host our components.  For the purpose of this training, we will use [KSS Node](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node) to build our living styleguide.  Lucky for us, Mediacurrent's theme generator already provides KSS Node fully integrated with our new Drupal theme.
